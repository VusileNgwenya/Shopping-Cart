My Shopping Cart App is a command-line Python program that allows users to build a simple shopping cart by entering the name and price of food items. As users add items, the app keeps track of each entry and calculates the total cost in real-time. This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as loops, user input, lists, and basic arithmetic, making it a great beginner-friendly tool for learning how to handle data and perform calculations in Python.
